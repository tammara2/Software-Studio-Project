# How to Update With Waste Data


Take the waste data (Quarterly but ideally monthly) and turn it into CSV format. 

Upload the CSV into the file base and take the python script to take the data from the csv.

Update the monthly value and yearly value to the appropriate filenames. 

With this, the graph will continuously upload Waste data, as the csv updates, and the numbers will update accordingly.
